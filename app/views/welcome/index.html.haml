Their dreams remain unfulfilled as they step out into the world without any hope of support. They are forced by their circumstances to take up any kind of job they get in order to earn their living even though they would like to take up higher education . It is obvious that they are deprived of equal opportunities of education and employment.
            %p.text-muted.text-justify The centre has extended a helping hand to such youth. The centre has 32 students ( 24 boys & 8 girls) and aims to extend its support to 100 orphan , needy students with education, lodging, employment, vocational skills through adopting their responsibility within next 3 year. We are trying to create 100 ROLE MODELS within next 5 years among orphan, deprived students. It will inspire other deprived students also to work for their better career & future.
